  - It also sets up instances of `Sheets` and `Drive` services using the Google API client libraries.

### Service Initialization:

- **`getSheetsService()` and `getDriveService()`:**
  - These methods initialize the Google Sheets and Google Drive services respectively using appropriate credentials and scopes.

### Google API Interaction:

- **Authorization and Credential Handling:**
  - `getCredentials()`: Retrieves and handles the required credentials for authorization using OAuth2 flow.
  
- **Reading from Google Sheets:**
  - `readFromSheet()` and `readFromSheetFull()`: Fetches data from specified ranges in Google Sheets and returns them as `ValueRange` or a structured map.
  
- **Writing to Google Sheets:**
  - `appendDataToSheet()`: Appends data to a specified range in a Google Sheet.
  - `updateDataInSheet()`: Updates existing data in a Google Sheet based on a specific ID.
  
- **Deleting from Google Sheets:**
  - `deleteRowById()`: Deletes a row from a Google Sheet based on a specified ID.

### File Handling:

- **Creating Excel Files:**
  - `createExcelFile()`: Creates an Excel file from provided data using the Apache POI library.
  
- **Downloading Data to Local Files:**
  - `downloadFile()`: Downloads data from a Google Sheet and creates an Excel file locally in the specified download folder.

### Utility Functions:

- **Adjusting Range:**
  - `adjustRange()`: Parses and adjusts the range format for Google Sheets.

### Syncing and Updating:

- **Local File Management:**
  - `updateLocalFile()`: Updates a local Excel file with new data.
  - `readLocalFile()`: Reads data from a local Excel file and converts it into a structured list.
  - `convertSheetToList()`: Converts Excel sheet data to a list structure.
  
- **Synchronizing Data:**
  - `syncWithGoogleSheet()`: Compares data from a local Excel file with data in a Google Sheet, updating the local file if changes are detected.

### Miscellaneous:

- **Folder Handling:**
  - `getDownloadFolderPath()`: Gets the default download folder path for storing downloaded files.

### Main Method (Example Usage):

- The `main` method contains commented-out examples demonstrating how to use various methods to perform operations such as appending data, deleting rows, creating a new Google Sheet, and syncing data between local files and Google Sheets.

### Error Handling:

- The class employs basic error handling, including exception logging and printing error messages to the console.

### Overall:

This `SheetUtils` class acts as a comprehensive utility for handling interactions between Java applications and Google Sheets, providing methods for data manipulation, synchronization, and file management. It encapsulates functionalities related to reading, writing, updating, and deleting data both locally and in Google Sheets, aiming to streamline data handling processes within an application.
